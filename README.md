# 📉 Unemployment Rate Prediction Website

This project is a front-end + Flask-based web interface for predicting **unemployment rates** using historical data and machine learning. It features a clean HTML/CSS interface, easily customizable, and designed to integrate with a backend ML model for real-time predictions.

The primary goal is to present unemployment forecasts in an accessible and user-friendly way for educational, business, or government planning purposes.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goals of this project are:

- ✅ Design a clean, responsive, and interactive web interface for predicting unemployment.
- ✅ Provide a base to connect machine learning models for real-time prediction.
- ✅ Help users analyze future unemployment trends for better economic and employment planning.
- ✅ Visually represent the idea of data-driven economic forecasting.

Unemployment prediction is useful for policymakers, businesses, and economists to identify potential crises, set policies, and adjust labor strategies.
